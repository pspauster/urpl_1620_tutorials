## Cleaning Data

Let's read in data like we did last time. We're going to "clean" it, which just means making it easier to use and getting it into tidy format.

```{r}
fhv <- read_csv(file = "For_Hire_Vehicles__FHV__-_Active.csv")
```

When we read this in, we have some unfriendly names of variables with spaces in them. To access those variables we have to use `` `backticks` `` which are clunky. The **janitor** package has helpful data cleaning functions. Install it and take a look at the `clean_names()` function.

For many functions, the first **argument** is always the name of a dataframe. In this case we want to clean the names of our `fhv` dataframe.

```{r}
library(janitor)
fhv_clean <- clean_names(fhv)
```

Now our names are clean - they are all lowercase, and have replaced all spaces with underscores. This will make it easier to refer to our column names as we transform data going forward.

But instead of assigning a new dataframe each time we want to apply a function, we should apply more than one function at once.

## The Pipe

Let's say we also wanted to change the name of a variable. Using the pipe `%>%` we can apply multiple functions to the same dataframe. Use the shortcut `shift+command+m` on mac or `shift+ctrl+m on windows`

Let's try `rename()` a function to change the names of columns. I don't know what the "veh" column means so I'm going to look it up in the [data dictionary](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/8wbx-tsch/files/a33b2ee3-d844-4add-9785-3cd89a61b6b6?download=true&filename=MDTLCForHireVehiclesActive.xlsx) on the open data [page](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/For-Hire-Vehicles-FHV-Active/8wbx-tsch).

It's an indicator for whether the vehicle is hybrid, so i'm going to rename it "hybrid". Use the documentation for `rename()` to figure out the right syntax.

To use the pipe, start with the name of the data frame you want to edit, and then chain the pipes after each function using some indenting to organize your code.

```{r}
%>% 
fhv_clean <- fhv %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(hybrid = veh)

#clean_names() is empty because the first argument is just the name of the dataframe, which has been piped in for us
```

Now we have a dataset with clean names and a renamed column "hybrid"

As we learn more and more functions, we'll have longer chains of pipes to clean and construct datasets.

```{r}
fhv_clean
```
