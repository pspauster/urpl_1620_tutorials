Here I’ve loaded R version 4.3.1.\nWhen you load RStudio, the screen will be split in three. This is some important vocabulary to direct yourself around RStudio and get help when you need it.\n\nThe CONSOLE is where all your code is run. Here you will see the output from the code you run. The COMMAND LINE is where you can type in code and execute it to the console. Code you run in the console is not saved. Try typing 1+1 into the console, and you’ll see that R spits back 2.\nThe ENVIRONMENT is where all your data will be stored. R is an object oriented programming language. Think of it like having a bunch of spreadsheets open at once. The environment shows you all the data you have loaded, and what each dataset, list, or other object is called.\nThe DIRECTORY is in the bottom right. This links to all the files in your current folder, called your working directory. If you are ever in the wrong working directory, you can set it by running the setwd() function or going to “Session” -> “Set Working Directory.” We will keep files organized by using an R Project.\n\n1+1\n\n[1] 2"
