## Installing R and RStudio

To use R, we need R, the underlying language that runs our code, as well as R studio, an integrated development environment (IDE) that allows us to save files and edit and run code.

To get started, we'll visit [RStudio's homepage](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ "Download R and RStudio") to install R.

First, Install R for your operating system from [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/).

Then download the [latest version](https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/macos/RStudio-2023.06.1-524.dmg) of RStudio and open it.

## Opening RStudio

When you open R Studio, It will find the version of R you just installed, and load it. Here I've loaded R version 4.3.1.

When you load RStudio, the screen will be split in three. This is some important vocabulary to direct yourself around RStudio and get help when you need it.

The **CONSOLE** is where all your code is run. Here you will see the output from the code you run. The **COMMAND LINE** is where you can type in code and execute it to the console. Code you run in the console is not saved. Try typing `1+1` into the console, and you'll see that R spits back 2.

The **ENVIRONMENT** is where all your data will be stored. R is an **object oriented programming language**. Think of it like having a bunch of spreadsheets open at once. The environment shows you all the data you have loaded, and what each dataset, list, or other object is called.

The **DIRECTORY** is in the bottom right. This links to all the files in your current folder, called your **working directory**. If you are ever in the wrong working directory, you can set it by running the `setwd()` function or going to "Session" -\> "Set Working Directory." We will keep files organized by using an R Project.
