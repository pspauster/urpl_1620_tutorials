## Video Tutorial

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY7eqZwz63Q >}}

#### In this tutorial

Create a buffer of 1/2 mile around a point layer of subway stations, select all NYC tax lots that intersect with that buffer, and calculate the total residential units inside the buffer as a share of all residential units in NYC. Also, Clip the MapPLUTO layer of tax lots by the buffer for a neater visualization.
