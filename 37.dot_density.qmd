This tutorial shows you how to make a racial dot density map like the ones we viewed in class

Dot density is an alternative to choropleths to show concentration, especially when each dot represents a number of people, households, occurrences, etc.

It is more common to display a single variable with dot density, as opposed to multiple as the racial dot maps do.
