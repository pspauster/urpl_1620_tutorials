You can put more info here, like the example below

To use R, we need R, the underlying language that runs our code, as well as R studio, an integrated development environment (IDE) that allows us to save files and edit and run code.

To get started, we'll visit [RStudio's homepage](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ "Download R and RStudio") to install R.

First, Install R for your operating system from [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/).

Then download the [latest version](https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/macos/RStudio-2023.06.1-524.dmg) of RStudio and open it.

## When you add new pages...
