## Setting up your first QGIS project

In this tutorial: download shapefiles from the NYC Open Data Portal, open QGIS, save a QGIS project, and orient to the QGIS interface

Download the latest **Long Term Version** of QGIS [here](https://www.qgis.org/download/).

The most common issue with installing QGIS is for Mac users the first time you open up the program. You’ll often see an error message that says *“QGIS” can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.*

**You don’t need to worry about this message**; QGIS is trustworthy. If this happens, locate QGIS in Finder and right-click, then Open from that menu. That should resolve the problem.
