This is some important vocabulary to direct yourself around RStudio and get help when you need it.\n\nThe CONSOLE is where all your code is run. Here you will see the output from the code you run. The COMMAND LINE is where you can type in code and execute it to the console. Code you run in the console is not saved. Try typing 1+1 into the console, and you’ll see that R spits back 2.\nThe ENVIRONMENT is where all your data will be stored. R is an object oriented programming language. Think of it like having a bunch of spreadsheets open at once. The environment shows you all the data you have loaded, and what each dataset, list, or other object is called.\nThe DIRECTORY is in the bottom right. This links to all the files in your current folder, called your working directory. If you are ever in the wrong working directory, you can set it by running the setwd() function or going to “Session” -\\> “Set Working Directory.” We will keep files organized by using an R Project."

install packages beyond the preinstalled.\nWe install packages with a console command, using a function called install.packages(). We can get our first, and most crucial package, the tidyverse, using this function. Copy this into your console. Make sure to put the package name in quotes.\n\nWe can install multiple packages at once by putting them into a list (also called a vector), like so. More on lists later.\n\nFinally we need to load packages at the beginning of our .R script in order to use them. The library() function loads functions that we have installed. Note that we only need to install packages once, so we use the command line. But we need to load packages with library each time we use them, so we put that in our .R script.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'tidyverse' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'tibble' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'readr' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'forcats' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.1.3\n\n\n-- Attaching core tidyverse packages ------------------------ tidyverse 2.0.0 --\nv dplyr     1.1.2     v readr     2.1.4\nv forcats   1.0.0     v stringr   1.5.0\nv ggplot2   3.4.2     v tibble    3.2.1\nv lubridate 1.9.2     v tidyr     1.3.0\nv purrr     1.0.1     \n-- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\nx dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\nx dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\ni Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors"

    "text": "Functions\nSo how do these functions we’ve been using work?\nEach function has a name and arguments. The name of a function tells R the operation we want to do. The arguments are the inputs for the function, or what we want to transform.\nYou can look up any R function by typing the function name into the console, preceded by a ?.\n\n?install.packages()\n\nstarting httpd help server ... done\n\n\nWhen we look at the first function we used, install.packages() the help menu pops up in the bottom right, describing the function, the arguments, and giving us examples. The first argument is called pkgs and it’s defined as “character vector of the names of the packages whose current versions should be downloaded from the repositories.” That first argument is required. Without it install.packages() won’t know which package to install.\nNote that the argument here, the name of the package, is in quotes. In programming, quotes define character objects. In this case the function requires a character input, so we use quotes. More on this later when we talk about data types.\nArguments in R can be named or ordered. Naming an argument means adding the name of the argument, followed by = and then the value of the argument. Unnamed arguments rely on the programmer to put each argument in the proper order, separated by commas. In this case, pkgs is the first argument. So install.packages(pkgs = \"tidyverse\") and install.packages(\"tidyverse\") do the same thing. When you are getting started programming, it’s good practice to name your arguments."

The tidyverse uses a principle of tidy data, a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. In tidy data…\n\nEvery column is a variable.\nEvery row is an observation.\nEvery cell is a single value.\n\nNext time we’ll learn how to read in data, keep it tidy, and get our observations in the right data types."
